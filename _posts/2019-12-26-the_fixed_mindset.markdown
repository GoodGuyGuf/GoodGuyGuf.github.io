> One of the most basic beliefs we carry about ourselves, Dweck found in her research, has to do with how we view and inhabit what we consider to be our personality. A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled. A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Out of these two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior, our relationship with success and failure in both professional and personal contexts, and ultimately our capacity for happiness.

I knew joining the software engineering online full time track at Flatiron school would not be an easy task for me. So far it has been difficult overcoming my own irrational beliefs towards learning. I was not educated to accept failure; I was educated to accept my limits as they were: set in stone. 

At first I thought if I didn't get something right the first time I must not be good at it. It was a few weeks before I actually considered that going back and reviewing lessons or labs multiple times (even if it was from the very start) and even getting a little behind where everyone else was in the curriculum would be more beneficial than I thought it would be. Once I got through a review of the entire curriculum, I was able to fully wrap my head around everything and remember what I needed to know. 

Flatiron has been very helpful in getting through this boundry. They teach you the problem solving skills you need to succeed. Every month that passes by reaffirms that the growth mindset is achievable and sustainable.
