> One of the most basic beliefs we carry about ourselves, Dweck found in her research, has to do with how we view and inhabit what we consider to be our personality. A “fixed mindset” assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful way, and success is the affirmation of that inherent intelligence, an assessment of how those givens measure up against an equally fixed standard; striving for success and avoiding failure at all costs become a way of maintaining the sense of being smart or skilled. A “growth mindset,” on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Out of these two mindsets, which we manifest from a very early age, springs a great deal of our behavior, our relationship with success and failure in both professional and personal contexts, and ultimately our capacity for happiness.

I knew joining the software engineering online full time track at Flatiron school would not be an easy task for me. So far it has been difficult overcoming my own irrational beliefs towards learning. I was not educated to accept failure; I was educated to accept my limits as they were: set in stone. 

If you fail at something enough you must not be capable. You must not be able to handle it. Someone else could do it better. It's too bad that that was your limitation in understanding. I don't know why teachers thought that way and educated their students to follow that logic. It's illogical to think that something is beyond anyone's understanding. Provided enough patience, understanding and different strategies to help someone learn they will obviously eventually get it. 

At first I thought if I didn't get something right the first time I must not be good at it. It was a few weeks before I actually considered that going back and reviewing lessons or labs multiple times (even if it was from the very start) and even getting a little behind where everyone else was in the curriculum would be more beneficial than I thought it would be. It was tremendously helpful because there is a lot of information to remember and I had a little trouble recalling things. It is reassuring to have all of that information on your mind at once, being able to call on it when you need it and having it succeed in your code.

I love overcoming each difficulty because it gives me more experience and knowledge to work with. I have better planning and problem solving skills than I did months ago. More often it seeps into my life outside of programming (I have even dreamt in ruby some nights) and I incorporate the same logic in my plans. Every day I get better at it. 

Hopefully the remnants of my fixed mindset can go away faster. It is discomforting for it to pop up into my mind everytime I struggle.
