It is finally done and my programming devil fruit powers have awoken!

Most people I know either do not know about One Piece or are afraid to start watching it.

One Piece is the number 1 best selling manga in the world. It was turned into an anime show in the 90s and is still ongoing with 900+ episodes! It is crazy long. Online many people have been turned off by its giant episode count. VV

So I created a Command Line interface that introduces you to One Piece!

It will summarize what the show is about, show you how many episodes it has currently, give you a list and description of the main protagonists the Straw Hat Pirates, gives you a description of what Devil Fruits are and what Haki is as well as points you to websites that stream the show online.

It was quite a process in getting it to work. It was difficult to connect a scraper class to a menu and making sure everything that I scraped was parsed correctly. Then I had to switch what my menu class was calling on so that it wouldn't connect to my scraper class but to my object classes 'character' and 'devilfruit'. Then I got to make it all pretty with the gem 'colorize'!

My CLI could still be edited to be bigger. I only included the straw hat pirates, the three types of devil fruits, and what haki is. There are many more heroes and villains that I did not add, as well as a list of all of the devil fruits along with their users, and which users have haki abilities and the ones who do not.
