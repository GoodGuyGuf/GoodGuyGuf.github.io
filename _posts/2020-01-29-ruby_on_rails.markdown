The Sinatra Project flew by me fast. I spent the whole week doing 14 hour programming sessions. Now into the second week of Ruby on Rails I am blown away. Many things that make doing what you did in Sinatra easier plus many more feautres. They say that the more grounded you are in Sinatra that you will learn Rails easier and I agree. I'm loving these lessons and I'm loving the process. I already have a project idea in mind once project week comes along in 1 & 1/2 weeks. Which is also going to pass by quickly. 'Convention over Configuration' is very nice and I really like how clean it can be. 

So for right now this blog post is just barebones. Just wanted to get the late blog alert off the dashboard. 

I am looking forward to making this blog entry fit a difficult Rails programming issue. In my last Sinatra Blog post I got to write a nice extensive laid out explanation to how certain code works. It'll be nice to do that again.
