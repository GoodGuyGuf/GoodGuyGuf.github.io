It feels amazing getting to this second project. I am getting more attuned to the process of learning here at flatiron. In high school and college I didn't recognize my study patterns at all. I didn't implement real breaks either. The more I notice the patterns the easier it is to work with myself on getting things done. 

The best advice I recieved for this project was to make something that you would really use. Immediately I got three grand ideas: two of them ended up being for sinatra and the other ends up working well for rails.

Hole in the wall is a CRUD(Create, Read, Update or Delete), MVC(Models, Views, Controllers) Web application made using Sinatra. Users can favorite select stores they have been to or would like to visit, add a review to the stores they have been to and have access to all of their reviews and favorited stores. They cannot add a second review to a store but can edit their original submission. It allows users to sign up or log in to their accounts which then prompts them to either an error screen if their credentials aren't authenticated or the home page of hole in the wall. The home page shows all User reviews, gives an option to view all stores currently in the database and an option to view their account info or logout. 

I will update this blog post when I have it completely finished.
